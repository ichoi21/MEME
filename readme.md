# W06: MEME Finder using Third-Party APIs

This is a sample MEME finder from a class activity to create a MEME search.

The MEME is using a third party API, Giphy to find MEMEs.

The page enables for the user to input any text search for a specific MEME they like.
The user will also be able to define how many MEMEs they'd like to display by inputing an integer.

In order for the search to load; user must have provide an API Key in order to enable the function. (Have not learned to secure API Key this time of the bootcamp).
